I'm currently a software engineer at Cox Automtive in Dallas, TX where I work on a Scrum team that's responsible for building software for the Dealer.com web platform. Outside of work, I'm constantly reading and learning to improve myself and am currently working on a fun side project using technologies such as React, Redux, Electron, PouchDB, and Webpack. A couple quirks about me: I'm a big fan of standing desks and mechanical keyboards.</p><p>Note: The code for building this website hasn't been updated since February 2015 and aren't representive of my current skill set.</p>",
