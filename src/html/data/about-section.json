    "about-text": "<p>Hi, I'm Joey Nguyen. Welcome to my personal website! I'm currently a front end developer at Dealertrack Technologies in Dallas, TX where I work on a team that's building a new and improved web app for our business customers, following the Agile (Scrum) methodology. Outside of work, I'm focusing on improving my skills in technologies such as AngularJS, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I also have a Beaglebone Black that I'm playing around with. A couple quirks about me: I'm a big fan of standing desks and mechanical keyboards.</p><p>Note: While I do believe support for IE 8 is important for business websites, I've made the conscious decision not to support it with my personal site.</p>",
